# Overview

This is where we store Zod Schemas for our code base.

## Update Vc Schemas from vc-schemas repo

- Check and configure according to [readme.md](scripts%2Freadme.md)
- run `pnpm run update-schemas`


## OPA Client

Opa client is automatically generated client for interacting with open-policy-agent API.
OPA api is very stable and not subject to many changes, so don't expect this to change often

## Generate new API client

In case of changes, run `pnpm run generate-typescript-client`. It uses publicly stored latest version of OPA API schema

From mono-repo, run `pnpm run generate-api-client`.

## Adding Entrypoints

If you need to add entrypoints to expose additional schemas in new files, use:

`pnpm preconstruct dev`
